# PlacesAPI
This is API which is designed for our new project to find entertainment around yourself. We strive to work on the principles of CI\CD so we use Docker, scan code using SonarQube and temporary deploy our services to Heroku(move to AWS in the future). Of the technologies that we use: c3p0, PostgreSQL, Java 8 and Spring 5.0.6.

### Local development
We use docker-compose for local development, so only run

```sh
$ docker-compose up --build
```

And check this URL

```sh
http://localhost:8080/PlacesAPI/helloWorld
```

**Good luck**
